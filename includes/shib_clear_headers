# Ensure that you add directives to clear input headers for *all* attributes
# that your backend application uses. This may also include variations on these
# headers, such as differing capitalisations and replacing hyphens with
# underscores etc -- it all depends on what your application is reading.
#
# Note that Nginx silently drops headers with underscores
# unless the non-default `underscores_in_headers` is enabled.
